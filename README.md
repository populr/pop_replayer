###To use:

If you have a log file generated by Rails, paste it's contents into log.txt, or create a new text file with the log contents.

Open processor.rb and update the Pop ID variable and the path to the log file. Run it on the command line. This script generates diff.txt, a file with just the relevant pop changes in it.

Open diffs.txt and visit the index.html page in a browser. Copy paste the contents of diffs.txt into the text area that reads "Paste Diffs Here". Then press Next Step to start observing the pop's creation.

Note that if you didn't get the entire log file, you may need to provide initial pop contents in the left-hand textarea on index.html. However, most of the time if you grab the entirety of the changes to the pop since it's creation, "[]" is the correct initial state.
